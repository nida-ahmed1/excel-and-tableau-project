# Data Visualisation using Tableau and Excel

As part of this project I used a publicly available data set on the Wealth of nations including seperate worksheets on GDP per capita, Life Expectancy at Birth and Smartphone Users Worldwide.  I used Excel to format the data, to create a table using filtered data as well as creating a tableau dashboard based on some of the worksheets within the Excel dataset.

## Aims:
To clean, format and filter the Wealth of Nations dataset and create visualisation to present findings using Tableau.

## Data:
